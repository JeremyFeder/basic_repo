        The 12-ounce brown bottle drops a dark brew into the glass, with a vibrant brown hue and a tight and slightly off-white head that settles to a creamy ringed lace. Nose is a bit biscuity, with hints of bark, chicory, toasty bread crusts, nuts, subtle dark chocolate and coffee. Creamy on the palate, with an underlying tingle of carbonation highlighted by an aggressive citric-rind hoppiness and an acrid bite. Malts are toasty, roasty and moderately sweet, offering nutty flavors of biscuit, earth and roots, a bitey coffee backbone, chicory, powdery chocolate and brown bread. The finish is dry and powdery, with lingering hints of biscuit and bark.
